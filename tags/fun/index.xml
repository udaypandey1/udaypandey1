      <description>swimming
I went swimming with the boys. Link to heading And it was fun. I am quite new to swimming. I learned the basics four years ago with Dad. I was really happy to find out that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t forgotten much.
I had my meal at home before 9 am and went to hostel. There I met Sachet and Amrit. Then we walked about 30 minutes to reach Marigold Party Palace, where Samir was already waiting for us.</description>
