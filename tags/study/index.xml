      <description>autopsy
I performed my first autopsy. Link to heading This was in our forensic medicine practicals. We had a senior doctor guiding us, and also a helper. I immediately volunteered to perform the autopsy. Two other guys also volunteered.
It was a unique experience. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t nervous at all. I honestly felt nothing, other than slight anticipation. Also the body wasn&amp;rsquo;t that bad, it was pretty well preserved.
I performed an incision of the torso, I cut open the stomach, and also examined the heart, which was taken out of the body.</description>
