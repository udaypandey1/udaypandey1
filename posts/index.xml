I went to Gosaikunda. Link to heading We had been planning to go there for about a month, and we finally did it.
We started our journey on 14th April (Baisakh 1). The group consisted of Samir, Amrit, I.
We took a bus from Buspark to Dhunche, Rasuwa. It took about 6 hours. We started our trek from Dhunche at 1 pm.
On the first day, we walked 5 hours.</description>

I performed my first autopsy. Link to heading This was in our forensic medicine practicals. We had a senior doctor guiding us, and also a helper. I immediately volunteered to perform the autopsy. Two other guys also volunteered.
It was a unique experience. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t nervous at all. I honestly felt nothing, other than slight anticipation. Also the body wasn&amp;rsquo;t that bad, it was pretty well preserved.
I performed an incision of the torso, I cut open the stomach, and also examined the heart, which was taken out of the body.</description>

      <description>So, I made a website using Hugo. And it was very easy. Link to heading It&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to build a website. It took me about one week of searching, reading and copy-pasting to build this website. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to make a wordpress website, that would have been way easier. I chose to use Static Site Generators (SSGs)1. Making a website with SSGs is also pretty easy, but for someone like me, with no coding experience, this was quite a challenge.</description>
